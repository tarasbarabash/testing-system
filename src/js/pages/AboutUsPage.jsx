            Build the best LMS that is fun and easy to use
          </p>
          The best LMS in the world. Thatâ€™s our goal. You can already create
          exams, courses, assessments and quizzes. Or your own Academy. But
          thatâ€™s not where it stops. We aim high, and we like to challenge
          ourselves, so we can deliver great quality.

          <p className="muted text-center">A bunch of smart web owls</p>
          We are an international team of communication and tech professionals.
          Most of us are Dutchies: down to earth, but not wearing clogs all day.
          Brazil is responsible for the Latin twist, the USA for our confidence,
          England for a bit of discipline, and France for some elegance. All
          with one thing in common: we are happy and dedicated.

          <h4 className="heading-4 text-center">How we work</h4>
          <p className="muted text-center">Working like a well-oiled machine</p>
          We give support, we develop new features, we solve bugs. Thatâ€™s what
          we do all day in an eggshell ðŸ˜‰. To deliver quality, we prioritize our
          work. Therefore we use Scrum. In the meantime we learn, grow, and have
          fun. Because work isnâ€™t always about work.

          <p className="muted text-center">The nest from which we operate</p>
          Our office is located in the beautiful city of Delft. We designed it
          with great care to create a perfect workplace. A place where we can
          fully concentrate. A place where we have discussions, and give each
          other actionable feedback. But also a place where we celebrate our
          successes.
